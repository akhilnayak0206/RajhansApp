The Donation App<br />
This app was made using <strong>React Native</strong><br />
This is an Android and IOS App that helps the member of the committee to accept payment from a donor and give a receipt for the same. <br />
All the members have to log in with their credentials in order to use the app.<br />
In this app, all the members can view the total donation and total expense.<br />
The receipt can be shared using the share button on every receipt and it supports all the available apps on that device.<br />
The app can also save a contact that helps the user to directly add the donor's contact no. and then send it via WhatsApp.<br />
The Overview helps to look at the total amount made in a particular wing or total expense or to look at how much cash is left in hand.<br />
The Reset and Delete Database also shows which user has deleted any donors receipt.<br />
In this app, only the admin can add  any new member.<br />
<br />

<h1>Android</h1>
<br />
For android following packages are used:<br />
 react-native.<br />
 react-navigation.<br />
<strong> react-native-contacts</strong>: this is used to save contacts.<br />
<strong> react-native-firebase</strong>: this is used as a real-time database.<br />
<strong> react-native-share</strong>: this is used to share the receipt.<br />
 <strong>react-native-view-shot</strong>: this is used to take snapshot of the  receipt.<br />
<br />
<h1>IOS</h1>
<br />
For IOS Expo was used.<br />
All the packages needed were preloaded in Expo so there was no need of adding any dependency.<br />
