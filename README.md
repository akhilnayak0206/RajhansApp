The **Donation App**.  
This app was made using **React Native**  
This is an **Android** and **iOS** App that helps the member of the committee to accept payment from a donor and give a receipt for the same.  
All the members have to log in with their credentials to use the app.  
The receipt can be shared using the share button and it can share the receipt in any way that the donor's like.  
The app can also save a contact that helps the user to directly add the donor's contact no. and then send it via WhatsApp or any other platform.  
The Overview helps to look at the total amount made in a particular wing or total expense or to look at how much cash is left in hand.  
The Reset and Delete Database also show which user has deleted any donor's receipt.  
In this app, only the admin can add any new member.  
This app **successfully** recorded transactions more than **Rs. 220,000**.  
Please do check out the **Screenshots** folder.
